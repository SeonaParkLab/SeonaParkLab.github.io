Coal Powerplant challenges in CN, KR, Asian countries and DE
---
Problem: labor/land issues due to phasing-out coal
  * Issues are highly embedded in the context, so need to develop
  * Phase1: Korean case (ongoing)
    * Labor issue
    * Land recovery issue
  * Phase2: Global comparison
    * Find accessible case around here
    * Just transition: with Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg (DE)
